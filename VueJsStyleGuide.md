# Simplified style guide from official vuejs.org

- multi-word component names (prevents conflicts with html names)
- component data must be a function (that returns an object)
- prop definitions should be as detailed as possible
- always use `key` with `v-for`
- scope component style (`scoped` attribute, css module, BEM convention, using unique css class name...)
- use `$_` to prefix private property names (e.g. `$_yourPlugniName_`) to ovoid conflicts withg Vue properties
